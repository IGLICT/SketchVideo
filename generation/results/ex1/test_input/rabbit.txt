A small, fluffy rabbit with soft, white fur and a pink nose hops gracefully from left to right across a lush, green meadow. The sun is setting, casting a warm, golden glow over the scene. The rabbit pauses momentarily, its ears twitching as it listens to the gentle rustling of the leaves in the nearby trees. It then continues its playful dance, moving side to side with an air of innocence and joy, the grass beneath its paws a soft carpet of nature's embrace.
