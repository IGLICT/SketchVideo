A mouthwatering round cake, adorned with  a dusting of powdered sugar, and a generous drizzle of glossy, dark chocolate ganache. The cake itself is a masterpiece of delicate sponge layers, each separated by a rich, velvety buttercream frosting that peeks through the sides, inviting everyone to take a slice. The scene is set with a soft focus on the cake, positioned on a marble countertop, with gentle lighting casting subtle shadows to accentuate its delectable texture.
